Constellation Network's metagraph technology is powerful.

To make it more popular, it is necessary to have some support utilities.

Constex Xlam is one such support utility.

It uses the popular Excel platform.

As an Xlam file placed in an XLSTART folder, it is available whenever Excel program is opened.

This Xlam appears as Constex menu on Excel's menubar.

When Constex menu is clicked, Constex ribbonbar appears.

This ribbonbar has buttons for several useful macros.

At this stage, macros are still under construction.

Info button gives a window with information about the macros.

Docker, GitHub, Euclid, Metagraph, Dashboard, and SampleUI buttons are for installing these items.

Nodes, Walltets, Transacts, Periods, and Incidents buttons in the Reports group generate Excel spreadsheet reports.

Similar buttons in the Statistics group generate statistics and charts.

SetWallet, BuyDAG, SendDAG, CreateForm, and SendData buttons carry out these procedures.
